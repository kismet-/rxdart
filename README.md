# rxdart

`rxdart` is a Dart reimplementation of the RxJS API, it aims to follow the [Reactive Extensions For JavaScript](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs) contract as much as possible.

## Introduction

Reactive programming is a paradigm centered around data streams and the propagation of change. This `rxdart` package provides a fresh implementation of major stream classes such as `Observable`, making it distinct from other [RxDart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) packages available. It provides developers familiar with RxJS a more seamless experience when working with Dart.

## Features

- 🚀 Reimplementation of major stream classes like [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/Observable) and [`BehaviorSubject`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/BehaviorSubject).
- 🔄 Tailored for those familiar with the RxJS API.
- ⚙️ Custom transformers for advanced stream manipulation.
- 💡 Detailed logging for easy debugging.
